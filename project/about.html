    <h2 id="us">About Us</h2>
    <p id="all">
      As a young man, A.M. Buhari had to leave his village in Tirunelveli
      district and go to Sri Lanka. It took him a few years of studying &
      working hard, but he ultimately knew that food was his calling. He first
      set up Hotel De Buhari in Colombo. Later, he decided to return to India,
      and establish the first branch of Buhari Hotel at Anna Salai, in 1951. The
      aim was to give the foodies from Madras an upscale dining experience. He
      was the herald of the fine-dining scene in Madras, where he drew
      inspiration from his frequent travels abroad. Cutlery and crockery,
      espresso machines, and even a jukebox were introduced which set Buhari
      Hotel apart from the other diners. Celebrities such as M.G. Ramachandran,
      Raj Kapoor, Sivaji Ganesan and Sridevi have tasted & relished our renowned
      food. Now we have 7 branches in Chennai- Anna Nagar, Ashok Nagar, T Nagar,
      Chrompet, Kilpauk, Nandambakkam, & Vandalur. 2009 "13 years after our
      grandfather's demise, we hoped to revive the level of fine-dining that had
      gone missing. We are the third generation & each day we strive to provide
      our customers the best quality of food & hospitality." - Sameer Basheer
      (Director) Our new branch was started in 2009 in Anna Nagar, which soon
      became an overwhelming success. The citizens of Chennai became nostalgic
      tasting the classic dishes in a new & improved ambiance. In 2010, we
      introduced a new chicken dish - Chicken 2010, & it grew into one of our
      customers' favorites.
